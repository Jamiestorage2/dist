Things to check in the code, as this is the expected workflow. 


Keyhunt visualizer syncs with command and control. 

On sync it sends all blocks scanned.
On sync it sends all key ranges sent with any key ranges it skipped or missed. 
On sync it will send any pool scraped blocks 
On sync it will send all key ranges scanned by pool 

On sync it receives blocks scanned.
On sync it receives all key ranges scanned from any other visualizer instance and also browser plugin instances 
On sync it will receives any pool scraped blocks 
On sync it will receive all key ranges scanned by pool 
By doing so all instances and the server stay in sync within a reasonable 0-300 seconds 

The reason is, we are scanning different sizes of keyspace and calling that 1 block. The browser is 1000k keys per block 
The pool is 35,184,372,088,831 keys per block
Our keyhunt visualizer is random depending on the size of block we decide to scan. 

I need the server to be able to understand all of this dynamically and ensure not a single key is missed or duplicate. 


The following is from the pool:

This is what I would like to be synced between the visualizer and the server and to be able to see who has scanned what section of keyspace and when 

You will also see i have a new script for installing onto ubuntu 22.04 this version is to be distributed to team members we need to ensure that if a team member finds the private key its displayed on the server and also synced to this version we are running locally. 

So im essence i am the master
2204 users are my team 
We are all synced via the server
Only I am made aware of found private keys. 
Found.txt is only created on my local master not on 2204 user's in the team. 
The server must also be notified and display the private key on the server admin panel. 

Issues I have noticed are that user id change in the 2204 team version stops me editing the username. It also means I dont see it on the server as a user. Look into this.
